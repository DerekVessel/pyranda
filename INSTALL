# Install notes for pyranda

## python-
Though other versions of python may very well work, we recommend and support
python 2.7 for pyranda.

## numpy-
As long as numpy is working with your version of python above, there will be no
compability issues.  This can be installed in a number of ways. http://www.numpy.org

## mpi4py
This python package provides MPI bindings to python and may or may not exists on your system
and python path.  At a minimum, the version of MPI used to build mpi4py must match the version
of MPI of your fortran compiler.  

To check your mpi4py config, run:
python -c "import mpi4py;print mpi4py.get_config()"

It is likely that you will need to build your own version of mpi4py to suite your specified compiler
type.  https://bitbucket.org/mpi4py/mpi4py


## fortran-
A fortran compiler with 2003 and above standards enforced and MPI libraries is required.
The MPI version used here should match that of mpi4py.

pyranda/src/fortran contains the fortran files and a makefile to create the python extension.  
The fortran compiler will need to be set here.  

f2py is also invoked at build time.  This utility installs with numpy and ought to be in your path.

To build, type:

make
make python


## Setup guide
To facilitate setup, a setup script will be created in due time which will:

- check for existance of python
- check for existance of numpy, f2py
- check for existance of fortran compilers
   - prompt for selection
- check for mpi4py version
  - if not matched with desired fortran, then will build this automatically
- build pyranda
- set PYTHONPATH
